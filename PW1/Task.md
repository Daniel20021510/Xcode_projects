If your project contains interesting solutions, exceptional code style, good presentation, easter eggs, jokes, unique references or well designed clean code (patterns, paradigms) up to two bonus points might be added. This means the maximum grade a student can receive per homework is 12. If interesting solution repeats in different projects bonus points won’t be added. It is pointless to try and prove to us that your solution is interesting. There won’t be any appeals regarding bonus points.
